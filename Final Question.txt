🔍 Task 1: Clean Your Training Data

Clean the data in historical_taxi_rides_raw.
Create a copy named taxi_training_data_474 in the same dataset.
Ensure trip_distance is greater than 4.
Remove rows with fare_amount less than $2.0.
Validate reasonable latitudes and longitudes.
Ensure passenger_count is greater than 4.
Include tolls_amount and fare_amount in fare_amount_138.
Sample the dataset to less than 1 Million rows.
Copy only relevant fields from report_prediction_data.
⚙️ Task 2: Create a BigQuery ML Model

Build a model predicting fare_amount_138.
Name the model fare_model_551.
Achieve an RMSE of 10 or less.
Use TRANSFORM() for data transformations.
Utilize ST_distance() and ST_GeogPoint() GIS functions.
📊 Task 3: Perform Batch Prediction on New Data

Predict fare_amount_138 using ML.PREDICT.
Store results in 2015_fare_amount_predictions.
Use data from taxirides.report_prediction_data.
